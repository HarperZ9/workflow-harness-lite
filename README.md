Workflow Harness Lite is a dependency-free Node CLI for small automation runs. It
accepts a JSON task config, runs independent commands in parallel, redacts output
previews, and can write a bounded-run receipt for unattended agent workflows.

## Why it matters

Agent and release workflows need a local runner that terminates predictably and
leaves a compact report. This repo gives developers a small harness for repeated
checks without introducing a full CI system.

## Try it

```bash
npm test
node bin/workflow-harness-lite.js --help
node examples/demo.mjs
```

## What to test first

- Run `npm test`.
- Run the demo and inspect the generated task report.
- Generate a Telos receipt with `--telos-receipt receipt.json`.

## Current status

Node 18+ CLI and importable module with tests. It runs local commands only and
keeps raw commands/output out of the interop receipt.

## Existing technical notes

> Lightweight local workflow runner with parallel task execution.

It accepts a JSON config with named command tasks, runs independent entries in
parallel by default, and returns a compact pass/fail report for local automation
or release checks.

It can also emit a Project Telos bounded-run receipt for unattended agent
workflows. The receipt records terminal status, task identities, command hashes,
output hashes, timeout bounds, and privacy gates without exposing raw commands
or raw stdout/stderr.

Built with agentic assistance and manually reviewed for safety.

## Install

No runtime dependencies. Use it from a clone:

```bash
npm test                 # optional: runs the bundled tests
node bin/workflow-harness-lite.js --help
```

## Usage

```bash
echo '{ "name": "local-checks", "tasks": [{"name":"ping","command":"node -e \"console.log(\\"ping\\")\""}] }' > workflow.json
node bin/workflow-harness-lite.js --config workflow.json --telos-receipt receipt.json
```

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for the full flag reference, the importable API
(`runWorkflow`, `runTasks`, `runTask`, `sanitizeOutput`, `buildTelosReceipt`),
and worked examples with expected output. A runnable end-to-end demo lives in
[`examples/demo.mjs`](examples/demo.mjs):

```bash
node examples/demo.mjs
```

## Report

- JSON report includes status, duration, redacted stdout/stderr previews, and
  command outcomes.
- Telos receipt output uses `project-telos.bounded-run-receipt/v1`, maps
  workflow pass/fail to `ok`/`error`, and keeps raw commands/output out of the
  interop artifact.
- Output previews are capped; use `--output-limit` to tune the character limit.
- Exit code is non-zero when any task fails.

## For developers

Keep the public README, package metadata, and examples aligned with current behavior. Before opening a PR or pushing a release, run the local Node verification path.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
