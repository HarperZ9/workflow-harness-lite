"""Verify docs/art/receipts.json: each listed file's SHA-256 must match its stored bytes.

Usage: python scripts/check_art_receipts.py [receipts.json]
Exit 1 on any digest mismatch, malformed receipt, or if no listed file could be checked.
A listed file that is absent from the checkout is reported and skipped: receipts also
list renders (PNGs, extra SVGs) that are never committed. Checking is on committed bytes
only, so it shows the bytes match the receipt, not that the scene produced them.
